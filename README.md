# Advanced-Machine-Learning-for-House-Price-Prediction
This project used machine learning to improve house price prediction, a key concern for buyers, sellers, and investors. 

Using the Kaggle dataset "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques," which includes 79 variables in homes in Ames, Iowa, we applied data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the data. 
The work evaluated a wide range of property features, including physical attributes, location specifics, and neighborhood characteristics, to increase the accuracy of house price predictions. 
Regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were evaluated, along with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize performance. 

# House Price Prediction API (FastAPI + XGBoost)

This project provides a live API for predicting house sale prices using a trained XGBoost regression model and engineered features, based on the Kaggle Ames housing dataset.

## Features
- Robust data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline
- Top feature selection (Pearson correlation)
- XGBoost model tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)
- API built with FastAPI for real-time prediction
- Example JSON input and output
- Input features:
