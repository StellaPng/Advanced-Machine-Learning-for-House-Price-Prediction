# Advanced-Machine-Learning-for-House-Price-Prediction
This project used machine learning to improve house price prediction, a key concern for buyers, sellers, and investors. 

Traditional valuation methods often overlook complex relationships between property features; machine learning models can better capture these dynamics. 

Using the Kaggle dataset "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques," which includes 79 variables in homes in Ames, Iowa, we applied data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the data. 
The work evaluated a wide range of property features, including physical attributes, location specifics, and neighborhood characteristics, to increase the accuracy of house price predictions. 
Regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were evaluated, along with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize performance. 

The goal is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately estimates house prices and identifies key predictors such as physical attributes, location, and neighborhood features. 
By enhancing prediction accuracy, this study supported smarter, data-driven decisions in real estate and contributes to the broader application of AI in smart urban development. It also encouraged academic collaboration and innovation in real-world AI use.
